# A-Smart-Educational-Tool-to-Promote-Literacy-In-Dyslexic-Children
To nurture children affected by dyslexia, various projects and programs are introduced to increase the phonological awareness in children.

Module 1 assesses the pronunciation frequency of dyslexic children, compares it to a predetermined frequency, and then displays the result on an LCD screen if there is a match.

Module 2 is responsible for transferring input from the parent/guardian device to the physical aid.

Module 3 displays the input character provided by parent/guardian on the 5x3 LED cube.
